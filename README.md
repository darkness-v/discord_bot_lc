- `/bind_profile <leetcode_username>` - Bind your LeetCode account
- `/show_profile [leetcode_username]` - Show LeetCode statistics

To run your bot 24/7, deploy it to a cloud platform. See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for detailed instructions.

**Quick Start:**

2. Deploy to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) (recommended, free $5/month credit)
3. Add environment variables
4. Done! Your bot runs 24/7

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step guides for Railway, Render, and DigitalOcean.

## Recent Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing titleSlug**: Added `titleSlug` to the returned data from `fetch_daily_question()`
2. **Submission fetching**: Changed to return a list and increased limit to 20 to find matching submissions
3. **Optional parameters**: Made `problem_slug` optional in commands so they default to the daily question
4. **Timezone**: Added Vietnam timezone (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh) for the daily task
5. **Error handling**: Added try-catch and better error messages for debugging
6. **Channel validation**: Added check to ensure channel exists before sending messages

### Timezone Note:
The bot now uses `pytz` to set the timezone to Vietnam time (UTC+7). If you're in a different timezone, change this line in `bot.py`:
```python
@tasks.loop(time=time(hour=6, minute=0, second=0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh')))
```

## Troubleshooting

If the daily task starts but doesn't complete:
- Check that `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` is correct in your `.env` file
- Verify the bot has permission to send messages in that channel
- Check the console for error messages (now includes detailed error logging)
